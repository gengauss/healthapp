        <p>From August 14th to 27th, our team conducted a survey for help with our project. We have targeted different age groups and professions asking questions on their general physical health and mental health. Moreover, we have created and distributed the questionnaire not only in Japan, but also including countries such as Australia, Uzbekistan, China, Vietnam, Germany and so on.
Overall, 286 people have participated in the survey from different parts of the world and of different ages. Considering that, we will do our best to generalize the health issue despite age, countries and anything else that makes people different.</p>
